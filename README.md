# Poly

`Poly` is an unofficial [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com) SDK, written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

This library makes it easy to integrate with Google Poly while providing a few additional client-side features.

* `5.0` - Target your Podfile to the latest release or master (will push when Cache updates)
* `4.2` - Target your Podfile to the `swift4.2` branch

## Important

Before you begin, ensure that you have read Googleâ€™s Poly [documentation](https://developers.google.com/poly/develop/), understand best practices for attribution, and have generated your API key.

## Quick Start

The sample project provides several examples for integration.

You can install the dependencies with the command `pod install` or by running the makefile commands `make setup && make pods`.

```ruby

# CocoaPods

pod "Poly", "~> 0.4.0"

# Carthage

github "piemonte/Poly" ~> 0.4.0

# Swift PM

let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/piemonte/Poly", majorVersion: 0)
    ]
)

```

Alternatively, drop the [source files](https://github.com/piemonte/Poly/tree/master/Sources) into your Xcode project.

## Examples

Import the library.

```swift
import Poly
```

Setup your API key.

```swift
Poly.shared.apiKey = "REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY"
```

List assets using keywords.

```swift
Poly.shared.list(assetsWithKeywords: ["fox"]) { (assets, totalCount, nextPage, error) in
	// assets array provides objects with information such as URLs for thumbnail images
}

// you may also query for the data directly for your own model creation

Poly.shared.list(assetsWithKeywords: ["fox", "cat"]) { (data, error) in
}
```

Get independent asset information.

```swift
Poly.shared.get(assetWithIdentifier: "10u8FYPC5Br") { (asset, count, page, error) in
	// asset object provides information such as URLs for thumbnail images
}

// you may also query for the data directly for your own model creation

Poly.shared.get(assetWithIdentifier: "10u8FYPC5Br") { (data, error) in
}
```

Download a 3D asset and its resources for rendering, either using the asset identifier or the asset model object itself.

```swift
Poly.shared.download(assetWithIdentifier: "10u8FYPC5Br", progressHandler: { (progress) in
}) { (rootFileUrl, resourceFileUrls, error) in
    if let rootFileUrl = rootFileUrl {
        let node = SCNNode.createNode(withLocalUrl: rootFileUrl)
        self._arView?.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(node)
    }
}
```

The API also provides private object loading but additional endpoints may need to be added. Auth support is setup and available via the `authToken` property.
